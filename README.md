# Projects
- **Business Analysis: Customer Behavior of Divvy Bikes in Q1 2024**
    - This project analyze Divvy's bike-sharing data to understand customer behavior, with the goal of converting casual riders into annual members. Using data from January to April 2024, the analysis includes data cleaning, trend identification, and visualization. Key insights reveal peak usage times, preferred bike types, and ride duration. Recommendations include targeting promotions during peak hours, weekend membership offers, and seasonal campaigns to encourage casual riders to become annual members, ultimately aiming to increase long-term customer loyalty and business growth.

- **Statistical Root Cause Analysis of Safety Operations at a Container Terminal**
    - This project analyze a historical accident data to understand the main root cause with the goal of pinpointing which root cause is the most significant in materializing accident occurrences. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, statistical analysis and interpretation. The main root cause is revealed to be "Method" (anything that is related to methodological or execution of a process task). Further analysis needs to be conducted, namely human reliability analysis.
    *Note that this project is a part of my undergraduate thesis with altered data to protect sensitive information which showcases statistical analysis and interpretation*
